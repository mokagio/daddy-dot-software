<p>One day, before my life as a daddy had begun, I was chatting with a person in the kitchen of a big corporate office floor. &ldquo;How was your weekend?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; I replied &ldquo;I made a lot of progress on a side project of mine&rdquo;. He smiled at me and said &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have children, do you?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, why?&rdquo; He just smiled.</p>

<p>As our little ones enter our lives, the spare time leaves.</p>

<p>Nappies to change, vomit to wash out, booboos to kiss, meals to prepare, activities to drive them too.</p>

<p>Besides, when you play, explore, cuddle, wrestle, read with them, time just flies, and more often than not your other half needs to call a time out for you rather than the kids.</p>

<p>Given that spare time is such a scarce and precious resource, parents want to make sure they use it to the best they can. But how to do it?</p>

<p>It all starts with <strong>time tracking</strong>. You can&rsquo;t judge what you can&rsquo;t measure, and so before being able to know if we&rsquo;re using our time in most effective way, we need to actually know how we&rsquo;re using it.</p>

<p>I have been <a href="http://daddy.software/post/2017-03-28-one-experiment-at-a-time/">experimenting</a> with time tracking over the past two weeks, and I&rsquo;ll share my setup, what it showed me, and some actions I am going to take as a result of it.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The setup</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve picked a number of tools to use in synergy to track how I spend time both when working and when not working.</p>

<h3 id="toggle">Toggle</h3>

<p><a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggle</a> is a time tracking web app with all the bells and whistles, which you can use free as long as you don&rsquo;t need features like teams and invoicing.</p>

<p>It has a companion iOS app, the two sync ok, but I found that it&rsquo;s better to always start and stop your current timer using the same client.</p>

<p>What I really like about Toggle though is their Chrome plugin.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/daddy.software/2017-04-15-toggl-dashboar.png" alt="_the Toggl dashboard" /></p>

<p>Having the button always present in the Chrome toolbar makes it easy to track in a granular way.</p>

<p>The plugin can also work as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro timer</a>, which I find quite useful.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/daddy.software/2017-04-15-toggl-chorme-plugin.jpg" alt="_Toggl's Chrome plugin can work as a Pomodor timer too_" /></p>

<h3 id="rescuetime">RescueTime</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> is a launch and forget tool for the Mac that tracks which apps you use, websites you visit, etcetera.</p>

<p>You can then log in the web interface and train it to categorize each entry as productive on non productive.</p>

<p>Using Toggle and RescueTime in combination is a great way to cross check how you work, and it can also deliver shocking news on how much time you spend on social media ðŸ˜³.</p>

<h3 id="moment">Moment</h3>

<p><a href="https://inthemoment.io/">Moment</a> an iOS app that enhance the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3240089/Now-Apple-game-shames-iPhone-users-New-iOS-9-feature-reveals-time-VE-wasted-checking-Facebook-playing-Candy-Crush.html">battery usage</a> feature to track the how much time is spent on the phone and how.</p>

<p>While the battery usage it&rsquo;s useful by itself to see how much time you spend on an app, or how much battery certain app consume in the background without you noticing, Moment gives you a more straightforward view on how much time you&rsquo;ve spent on your phone: the number of hours and minutes, and the number of time you picked it up.</p>

<p>If you upgrade via in-app purchase you&rsquo;ll unlock features like time awareness reminders and daily limits.</p>

<p>It also offers a family plan, to monitor the screen time on more devices together, but I haven&rsquo;t tried that.</p>

<h3 id="apple-watch">Apple Watch</h3>

<p>Being physically active is important for the daddies, we need to keep up with are kids, and gosh they have energy to spare.</p>

<p>I use the Activity app in the Apple Watch as a simple tracker for how much movement I&rsquo;m doing during the day.</p>

<p>I use to have a <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/">FitBit</a> Flex, which I would use to cross check the readings from the watch, but the rubber bracelet broke and I&rsquo;ve been to lazy to replace it.</p>

<h2 id="the-results">The results</h2>

<p>If anything all this tracking made me more aware of what I was doing while I was doing it. In particular, using Moment made me aware of how much time I spend on my phone, which resulted in me actually using it less after the first few days.</p>

<p>That the awareness of a certain thing being observed and measure results in us changing our behaviour towards it is a known phenomenon, usually referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne effect</a>.</p>

<p>Because Toggl makes you track only the time when you&rsquo;re actually working, and not the breaks, I realized that <strong>the time in which I&rsquo;m actually actively working is less than I thought</strong>. Even more reasons to find ways to become more effective during it.</p>

<p>That is not to say that taking breaks is a bad idea, or that it decrease ones productivity. There&rsquo;s a body of research that shows how our brain keep working on our problems <em>in the background</em> while we perform other tasks.</p>

<p>RescueTime can show you the total amount of time spent on each app over the course of the week. Unsurprisingly my most used app last week was <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>, but <strong>the second most used app was <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I was quite surprised by this. I consider myself a maker rather than a talker, and while using Slack doesn&rsquo;t mean slacking (<em>pun intended</em>) we can also safely assume that not all the time spent instant messaging is actually productive time.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/daddy.software/2017-04-15-rescuetime-activites.png" alt="_RescueTime weekly report by time spent on each app and website_" /></p>

<p>Moment showed me that <strong>I use my email client, <a href="https://slack.com">Spark</a> and my Twitter client <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> a lot</strong>, no surprises there. Once again, we can all agree that while there is value in networking and keeping up to date with the latest tech trends on social medias, the time spent there is not as value generating as doing actual work. The same is true for checking emails, with an impact which depends on the amount of work emails that one receives.</p>

<p>Apple Watch showed me that <strong>I don&rsquo;t move enough during the day</strong>. At first I found this surprising given how much I walk around nursing my 3 months old. Think more deeply about it though I realized that yes, if I don&rsquo;t get interrupted I can spend hours at my desk, either standing or sitting.</p>

<p>Finally as a bonus checking the battery usage every day made me realize that a few apps I have installed on my iPhone by I rarely open were using quite a bit of background resources. I deleted them.</p>

<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a few actions that I&rsquo;ve decided to take as a result of this time tracking analysis.</p>

<ul>
<li>Disable notifications for emails, and look at them only three times a day. Batching emails should help reduce the time spent on them due to less context switching.</li>
<li>Aggressively unsubscribe from all the unwanted emails, this should help reduce the time spent on the email clients even more.</li>
<li>Make sure the many services I use either ping me via email or via notification, but not both.</li>
<li>Use weekly rather than daily digests. I have a bunch of digests that I receive on a daily basis, I think the same informative result would be achieved by doing that on a weekly basis, while greatly decrease the time spent on them.</li>
<li>Try to have Slack free time during the day. I&rsquo;ll start with an hour, and try to make it grow as time goes by.</li>
<li>Move more, make sure I have at least a daily walk with pram (<em>which in case you didn&rsquo;t know is the Australian for buggy, because Aussie peeps like to change random words</em>) and/or dog.</li>
<li>Use social media less. In a podcast which unfortunately I can&rsquo;t recall I heard the host sharing that they use Facebook only when they are on the toilet, I might do the same with Twitter.</li>
<li>Pick up the phone less. Moment tracks the number of time you pick up your phone, and for me it easily went up over 50 times a day. Wow.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last point, using the phone less, is something that I started doing after a few days of using Moment.</p>

<p>I already feel better about it, and I&rsquo;m encouraging all you daddies to do the same. <strong>Use your phone less</strong>.</p>

<p>Is very easy to pick up the phone and read the news or browse Twitter while feeding a bottle to the baby, or looking after the kids while they&rsquo;re entertained by their toys. The fact is though, that despite our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a> all the content we&rsquo;re browsing will still be there when the kids have gone to bed, they on the other hand are growing up every day, and will never be like they are right now. We&rsquo;re better off enjoying them.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-you">What about you?</h2>

<p>What I shared here is my personal setup, and the conclusions I drew after being more serious about time tracking for two weeks, and what I plan to do about it. Like when describing a particularly bad piece of software it&rsquo;s always better to end by saying YMMV, your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you spend all your time between meetings and emails, or never leaving your fullscreen Emacs window, being more aware of what you are doing, and tracking and reviewing how you spend your time will help you find the low hanging fruits in terms of effectiveness and productivity.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve never done time tracking and want to start I think this setup is a great first step. If you&rsquo;ve been time tracking for a while and want to share how you do it and the tools you use <a href="https://twitter.com/mokagio">get in touch with me</a>, I&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>
