title: One Experiment At A Time
---

What many people get wrong in the world of A/B testing is that they test multiple things at the same time. This way if some of the metrics observed for the test improve, they're not sure what the real source is. Most of the time A/B tests focus on vanity metrics, so this is not a real problem.

For the software developer dad though, being able to make the most out of their work time is very important, so we won't make the same mistake. In this blog we'll always experiment with a change to our routine or setup at a time.

Many times I tried adopting big radical frameworks only to find out that they were too much for me to stick to. Sort of like a big bang release, too much to handle.

Since "life is a marathon, not a sprint", and "compound interest is the real source of wellness" is much better to commit to one little change per week and see whether it's worth sticking to it or not.

Now that we've cleared that out, the next post you'll write will be about the first experiment I'll try out. Stay tuned.
