This is just warm up post to verify the whole setup of the blog.

This MVP of sort is organized as a static website, generate using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and hosted via [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I might write more in depth about the actual deployment later on.

### About me

My name is Gio, on Twitter as [@mokagio](https://twitter.com/mokagio) and since January 2017 I am the proud dad of a smiley boy named Finn. I've been working in the software industry since 2011, and am focused on testing and productivity.

### About this blog

In this blog you'll find articles about productivity and time management for dads, from the point of view of a software developer geek.

Since I became a dad my free time has basically disappeared, so why not adding another side project to the mix? I mean... so I'm going to use this blog as an outlet to explore productivity and time management tips and techniques to make the most of my little spare time, and hopefully help some new dad along the way.
